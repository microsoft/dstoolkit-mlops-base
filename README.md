# MLOps Solution Accelerator

This repository contains the basic repository structure for machine learning projects based on Azure technologies (Azure ML and Azure DevOps). The folder names and files are chosen based on personal experience. You can find the principles and ideas behind the structure, which we recommend to follow when customizing your own project and MLOps process. Also, we expect users to be familiar with azure machine learning concepts and how to use the technology.

## Prerequisites

In order to successfully complete your solution, you will need to have access to and or provisioned the following:

- Access to an Azure subscription
- Access to an Azure Devops subscription
- Service Principal

## Getting Started

Follow the step below to setup the project in your subscription.

1. **Setting up the Azure infrastructure:**

   - For general best-practices, we invite you to visit the official [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/ai-machine-learning-resource-organization?branch=pr-en-us-1541)

   - if you are starting with MLOps, you will find the necessary Azure Devops pipelines and ARM templates in the folder _infrastructure_ to setup the recommended infrastructure. To deploy the infrastructure have a look at [Infrastructure Setup](./docs/how-to/SetupInfrastructure.md).

   - if you already have a preferred architecture and Azure resources, you can delete the infrastructure folder. Nevertheless, we invite you to have a look the recommended infrastructure ['AzureDevops'](./docs/how-to/SetupCICD.md). To use this template, you need to create a service principal to [manage identities in ADO](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure?view=azure-devops), (if needed) [connect Azure KeyVault to ADO](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/release/azure-key-vault?view=azure-devops), and [add environmental variables to in ADO](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/variable-groups?view=azure-devops&tabs=classic).

2. **Creating your CI/CD Pipeline to Azure Devops.** In the folder **./azure-pipelines** you will find the yaml file to setup your CI/CD pipeline in Azure Devops (ADO). To do so, have a look at ['Azure Devops Setup'](./docs/how-to/SetupCICD.md).

If you have managed to run the entire example, well done ! You can now adapt the same code to your own use case with the exact same infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Add your AML-related variables (model, dataset name, experiment name, pipeline name ...) in [configuration-aml.variable](./configuration/configuration-aml.variables.yml) in the _configuration folder_

2. Add your infra-related environment variables (azure environment, ...) in [configuration-infra*.variables](./configuration/configuration-infra-DEV.variables.yml) in the _configuration folder_. By default, the template provides two yml files for DEV and PROD environment.

3. Add your core machine learning code (feature engineering, training, scoring, etc) in **./src**. We provide the structure of the core scripts. You can fill the core scripts with your own functions.

4. Add your operation scripts that handle the core scripts (e.g sending the training script to a compute target, registering a model, creating an azure ml pipeline,etc) to **operation/execution**. We provide some examples to easily setup your experiments and Azure Machine Learning Pipeline

The project folders are structured in a way to rapidly move from a notebook experimentation to refactored code ready for deployment as following: ![design folder](docs/media/folder_design.PNG)

## General Coding Guidelines

For more details on the coding guidelines and explanation on the folder structure, please go to [data/docs/how-to](docs/how-to/TemplateDocumentation.md).

1. Core scripts should receive parameters/config variables only via code arguments and must not contain any hardcoded variables in the code (like dataset names, model names, input/output path, ...). If you want to provide constant variables in those scripts, write default values in the argument parser.

2. Variable values must be stored in **_configuration/configuration.yml_**. These files will be used by the execution scripts (azureml python sdk or azure-cli) to extract the variables and run the core scripts.

3. Two distinct configuration files for environment creation:
   - (A) for local dev/experimentation: may be stored in the project root folder (requirement.txt or environment.yml). It is required to install the project environment on a different laptop, devops agent, etc.
   - (B) for remote compute: stored in **_onfiguration/environments_** contains only the necessary packages to be installed on remote compute targets or AKS.

4. There are only 2 core secrets to handle: the azureml workspace authentication key and a service principal. Depending on your use-case or constraints, these secrets may be required in the core scripts or execution scripts. We provide the logic to retrieve them in a **_utils.py_** file in both **_src_** and **_operation/execution_**.
